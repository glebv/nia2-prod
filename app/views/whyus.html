			<h2>Health insurance made easy</h2>
			<p>We’re a new sort of health insurance, and we’ve got some of the best people in the business behind us. Our team has more than 100 collective years of experience in the big corporate health insurers you know. But, we are doing it differently! We are making health insurance that is easier to understand, better value and above all: human. This is the health insurance that we want ourselves.</p>
