# HEALTH.COM.AU v3 - Angular style

Woohoo! The new health site is on its way. Please read the following before you start developing!

## Installation
After cloning, make sure you run `$ npm install && bower install`.

`$ npm install` will install all dependancies. 
The most important to note are:
* Grunt
* Bower
* Yo

## Grunt

Grunt has 2 primary tasks: `serve` and `build`.

`$ grunt serve` creates a development server @ `127.0.0.1:9000` where you can preview everything, live reload as you work.

`$ grunt build` builds a production ready package. You shouldn't have to worry about this one though.

`$ grunt test` for running e2e tests (that need to be written).

## Bower

Bower is super cool - this is used for additional components, i.e. angular plugins. 

Please use the `--save` operator when using bower install, so we all get the sexy packages.

`$ bower install bower-component --save`

## Yo

This project uses the Yeoman generator to scaffold angular files. **PLEASE USE YEOMAN WHEN CREATING NEW FILES**. Although it may seem easy to create new files, we would like to keep a strict structure, as well as create all the necessary test docs (that we need to write later.......).

use it like so: 

`$ yo angular:controller MyController` - creates a new controller 'MyControllerCtrl'

`$ yo angular:view my-view` - creates a new view 'my-view.html'

`$ yo angular:directive my-directive` - creates a new directive - <my-directive></my-directive>

`$ yo angular:service MyService` - creates a new service - MyService

`$ yo angular:factory MyService` - creates a new service - MyFactory
